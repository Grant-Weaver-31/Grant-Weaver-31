### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Grant Weaver and I'm a data analyst who enjoys telling a compelling story with data.

You can see my different projects in the data analytics field while using Python, R, Excel, Tableau and SQL. However most of the repos that I will post on here will be Python, R and SQL. 

I love to use data anlytics to analyze men's professional singles tennis. 

### Volunteering
- I enjoy volunteering in local jails and prisons while using artwork as a medium to help incarcerated people deal with the struggles of being locked up. Hopefully, my work can help decrease the mass incarceration levels in the USA while aliviating the difficulties of being behiend bars. Poetry is my medium of artwork to connect with the people locked up.
