### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Grant Weaver and I'm a data analyst who enjoys telling a compelling story with data.

You can see my different projects in the data analytics field while using Python, R and SQL.

I love to use data anlytics to analyze men's professional singles tennis. 

### Volunteering
I enjoy volunteering in local jails and prisons while using artwork as a medium to help the incarcerated people deal with the struggles of being locked up. Hopefully, my work can help decrease the mass incarceration levels in the USA.
